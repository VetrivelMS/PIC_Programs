# PIC_Programs

This repository contains all my code on programming PIC microcontrollers

DISCLAIMER!!

    All my code is applicable only for PIC18F4550 Microcontroller. If you are using a different famiy or different chip of the same family, the code may not work properly.

    My code is for reference purpose only. My intention of posting my code in public is for my reference in future and for my colleagues reference only. Other poeple can also use this code as a reference.

    It should be noted that all my code is for learning and development purposes only.

    All the softwares and IDE's I use are licenced and free. I am using XC8 Compiler for compiling embedded C programs and pic-as Assembler for compiling assembly language programs.

    My code is in no way perfect. There might be bugs and there might be much more efficient way than my code. If you have any suggestions please contribute to the code. I will check the code and I will commit your suggestions in the code. This way we both can learn.

    I am in no way an expert in Assembly Language or PIC programming. I am a beginner and this repository is a timeline of me learning to code PIC Microcontrollers.

## Assembly Folder

        Assembly Folder contains all my code written in PIC18 Instruction Set for PIC18F4550 specifically.

        I have organised my code based on Category (Eg.. LCD Interface, SPI, I2C,etc..). Inside each category you will find a particular project and inside that project folder you will find the Assembly code. The project folder will also contain a ready to burn hex file. People can use the hex file directly and burn it to their chip directly if they want to.

        I will try to comment all my code. But in some cases, due to time constraints, I may not comment my code. Forgive me!!. But if you want comments for such files, then DM me or make a request, I will look into it.
